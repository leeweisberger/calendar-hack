description: 'Hal Higdon: Half Marathon 3 (HM3): "Welcome to Half Marathon 3, or HM3. This 
  is a new program created for Hal Higdon''s Half Marathon Training. It was designed to match 
  the popular Marathon 3 program that features 3 days of running a week and 2 days of 
  cross-training. It recognizes the fact that not all runners can handle 4, 5, 6 and 
  especially not 7 days of running a week. We are all different and achieve success by 
  various means. HM3 lasts 12 weeks aimed at the half marathon of your choice. In signing 
  up for HM3, be sure to set the correct end date so all of the workouts fall into place 
  for your goal race. Monday in HM3 is always a day of rest to recover from the hard 
  training on the weekend. Tuesdays and Thursdays are easy running days, conversational 
  pace mostly. In between on Wednesdays, you cross train, the most popular form of 
  cross-training being aerobic: cycling, swimming or even walking. Friday is another 
  rest day with long runs on Saturdays and cross-training on Sundays, although you 
  can flipflop those workouts for convenience." (more details at the link below)'
